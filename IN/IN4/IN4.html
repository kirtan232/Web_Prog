<h1> In class Activity 4: Q & A Page:</h1>
 
<div class="q-block">
<div class="question">Q-3: Load session-cookies-1.php in your browser, and read the "History Information" section near the top of the page.
Click reload a few times, and describe what, if anything changes.</div>
<div class="answer">ANS-3: The first time History Information section shows this “There is no record when you last visited this page previously” 
After clicking reload a few times, It shows this = “You have visited this Web page 7 times.
and the last visit was on Monday, July 7, 2025 at 6:16 PM” 
So, each time the user reload or comes back to the web site it will tell you how many times you have visited the web site before and it will also tell you what time you last visited web site.
</div>
</div>

<div class="q-block">
<div class="question">Q-4: Go to your browser, as described in Step 2, to locate the cookie for this Web page. (If your browser does not let you view the cookie directly, ask an instructor,or friend to help you locate the file of cookies for your computer or computer account.) Describe what information is set by session-cookies-1.php.</div>
<div class="answer">Ans-4: It stores the data as the following table 
"LAST_VISIT	Monday%2C%20July%207%2C%202025%20at%206%3A39%20PM	2025-07-21T18:39:14.276Z	59						Medium
VISIT_NUMBER	7"										
The cookie takes the time of the visit as “LAST_VISIT” stores the date and time.
And it also stores how many time the user have visited the web page as “VISIT_NUMBER” and it iterates by 1 every time the user comes to the web page again.
